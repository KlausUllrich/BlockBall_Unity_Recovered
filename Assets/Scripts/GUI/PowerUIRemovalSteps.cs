    STEP 1: TEMPORARY SOLUTION - DISABLE POWERUI ASSEMBLIES
    -----------------------------------------------------
    1. Open Unity Editor
    2. Go to Edit > Project Settings > Player
    3. Find "Scripting Define Symbols" under "Other Settings"
    4. Add: DISABLE_POWERUI
    5. Click Apply and let Unity recompile
    
    The above step will temporarily disable PowerUI compilation errors, but won't remove it.

    STEP 2: INSTALL REQUIRED UNITY PACKAGES
    ------------------------------------
    1. Open Unity Package Manager (Window > Package Manager)
    2. Click the '+' button > 'Add package by name'
    3. Add these packages one by one:
       - com.unity.ugui (Unity UI)
       - com.unity.textmeshpro (TextMeshPro)
    4. Wait for packages to install completely
    5. Restart Unity after installation
    
    STEP 3: CREATE UNITY UI PREFABS
    ----------------------------
    Follow the UISetupGuide.cs instructions to create your Unity UI prefabs:
    
    A. Create Canvas:
       - Right-click in Hierarchy > UI > Canvas
       - Add EventSystem if not automatically added
       
    B. Create UI Screens (as children of Canvas):
       - MainMenuScreen with Play and Exit buttons
       - GameScreen
       - LoadingScreen
       - IntroGamesAcademyLogo screen
       - Intro4MindsLogo screen
    
    C. Set up StandardUIManager:
       - Create empty GameObject in scene
       - Add StandardUIManager component
       - Assign UI screens to corresponding fields
       
    D. Connect to ScreenStateManager:
       - Find ScreenStateManager in scene
       - Assign StandardUIManager to m_xStandardUIManager field
    
    STEP 4: UN-COMMENT UI REFERENCES
    ----------------------------
    After installing the UI packages, go through all scripts and uncomment the UI references:
    1. Remove the comment markers (//) from all "using UnityEngine.UI" lines
    2. Remove the comment markers (//) from all "using TMPro" lines
    3. Remove the comment markers (//) from all "using UnityEngine.EventSystems" lines
    
    STEP 5: COMPLETELY REMOVE POWERUI
    ------------------------------
    1. Delete the entire PowerUI folder:
       - In Project panel, right-click Assets/PowerUI > Delete
       
    2. Remove any PowerUI-related DLLs in the Plugins folder:
       - Check Assets/Plugins for any PowerUI DLLs
       
    3. Delete the temporary UiManager (once StandardUIManager is working):
       - Assets/Scripts/GUI/UiManager.cs
       
    4. Remove the DISABLE_POWERUI define symbol:
       - Go back to Edit > Project Settings > Player > Scripting Define Symbols
       - Remove DISABLE_POWERUI
    
    STEP 6: FINAL CLEANUP
    -----------------
    1. Delete guidance files:
       - PowerUIRemovalSteps.cs (this file)
       - PowerUIRemovalGuide.cs
       - UISetupGuide.cs
       
    2. Delete the HTML files in Resources/GUI once they're no longer needed:
       - Move any assets you want to keep to a new location first
