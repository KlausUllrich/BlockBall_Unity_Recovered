    STEP 1: SETUP UNITY UI FIRST
    ---------------------------
    Before removing PowerUI, make sure you've set up the Unity UI system as described in UISetupGuide.cs
    
    STEP 2: REMOVE POWERUI REFERENCES FROM CODE
    -----------------------------------------
    1. All screen state classes should be updated to use StandardUIManager instead of PowerUI
       - ScreenStateMenu.cs
       - ScreenStateGame.cs
       - ScreenStateLoading.cs
       - ScreenStateIntro.cs
    
    2. Update ScreenStateManager.cs to use StandardUIManager instead of UiManager
    
    3. Create a temporary UiManager wrapper that redirects to StandardUIManager
       This allows the existing code to continue working during migration
    
    STEP 3: REMOVE POWERUI ASSETS
    ---------------------------
    1. Delete the PowerUI folder from the Assets directory:
       - Assets/PowerUI/
    
    2. Remove any PowerUI prefabs from scenes
    
    3. Remove PowerUI plugins:
       - Assets/Plugins/PowerUI/
       
    STEP 4: CLEAN UP HTML RESOURCES
    -----------------------------
    The HTML files in Assets/Resources/GUI/ are no longer needed but can be kept as reference:
    - Game.html
    - Intro4MindsLogo.html
    - IntroGamesAcademyLogo.html
    - MainMenu.html
    
    Consider moving any images referenced by these HTML files to your UI sprites folder.
    
    STEP 5: FINAL CLEANUP
    ------------------
    1. Thoroughly test the UI with the new Unity UI system
    
    2. Once everything is working correctly, you can remove:
       - UiManager.cs (the temporary wrapper)
       - This guide file and UISetupGuide.cs
    
    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    --------------
    - Unity UI uses Canvas and RectTransform-based layout instead of HTML/CSS
    - Event systems are different (Unity uses EventSystem, PowerUI used custom events)
    - Text rendering is different (Use TextMeshPro for best results)
