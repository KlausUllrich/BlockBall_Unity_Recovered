# BlockBall Evolution - Project Overview

## Project Name
Blockball Resurrection

## Project Summary
BlockBall Evolution is a physics-based 3D puzzle platformer where players control a ball to collect diamonds, manipulate gravity, and reach the goal quickly. Levels are modular, grid-based, and build out of different types of "blocks". Each block is 1x1x1 Unity units, which is divided into so called bixels(8√ó8√ó8 bixels per block). Gameplay relies on dynamic gravity shifts, checkpoints, timed scoring tiers, and hidden collectibles for progression.

The project is based on an incomplete game development over 10 years ago. It should now be brought to life with current technology.

## Technology Used:
- Unity 2022.3 
- Windows with Powershell

## Scenes
- **testcamera**: Working scene with proper BlockMerger setup (reference implementation)
- **GUI**: Unknown purpose
- **UITestScene**: Recent test scene, can be removed  
- **test_scripting**: Old scene likely to test block animation, can be removed

##  Architecture

### UI System Architecture
The UI system uses **ONE MainCanvas** with all UI screens as child GameObjects:
```
MainCanvas (Canvas, CanvasScaler, GraphicRaycaster)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MainMenuScreen (GameObject with UI components)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GameScreen (GameObject with UI components) 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LoadingScreen (GameObject with UI components)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IntroScreen (GameObject with UI components)
```
- **Clean UI Architecture**:
  - `WorldStateManager`: Manages world-related states
  - `ScreenStateManager`: Controls high-level game states (Menu, Game, Editor)
  - `StandardUIManager`: Shows/hides screen GameObjects based on current state
  - `PanelGroupManager`: Manages panels within each screen (e.g., MainMenu, LevelSelection)
  - `MainMenuUI`: Handles button events and panel navigation within MainMenuScreen
  - `LevelSelectionManager`: Handles level listing and selection functionality

- UI screens are GameObjects with RectTransform + CanvasGroup 
- They do NOT have individual Canvas components
- Screen switching = activating/deactivating child GameObjects


**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Adding Canvas components to individual screens
- Creating standalone prefabs that need instantiation
- Trying to make screens independent of MainCanvas
- Ignoring existing screen GameObjects in scene hierarchy


### Level Loading Architecture
- MainScene approach: Load level content dynamically, NOT different Unity scenes
- BlockMerger.LoadLevel() creates `new Level(fileName)` and calls `Build()` to parse XML files
- BlockMerger.cs loads XML level files, NOT Unity scenes
- Level.Build() reads XML from `Assets/Resources/Levels/` and creates GameObjects dynamically

**Level.Build()** reads XML level files from disk and creates GameObjects:
  - Creates `"LevelCubes"` GameObject with level geometry  
  - Creates `"BlockGroups"` GameObject with game objects
  - Parses XML files from `Definitions.relLevelFolder + fileName + ".xml"`


#### Level System
- `Level`: Core class that loads, builds and manages level components
- `LevelSet` & `Campain`: Handle collections of levels
- XML-based level definition format stored in `.lvl` files

#### Object Hierarchy
- `BaseObject`: Root class for all interactive objects
- `BallObject`: Base for ball-related objects
- `PhysicObject`: Handles physics interactions
- Key gameplay objects:
  - `Player`: The player-controlled ball
  - `Block`: Building blocks of levels
  - `GravitySwitch`: Changes gravity direction
  - `Goal`: Level completion trigger
  - `ScoreItem`: Collectible diamonds (also function as checkpoints)
  - `KeyItem`: Colored keys to unlock doors
  - `DoorObject`: Gates requiring specific keys
  - `InfoObject`: Displays help messages

#### Camera System
- `PlayerCameraController`: Handles camera movement, rotation, zoom
- Supports full rotation and alignment with gravity direction
- Implements transparency for obstructing objects

- Optimize performance and maintain backward compatibility for existing players.

## Session Continuity
To ensure progress across sessions, refer to this document for the latest status of Phase 0 tasks. Updates to code, documentation, and task completion will be logged here. If resuming after a break, review `Phase0_PhysicsMigrationTasks.md` for detailed implementation steps and `OldPhysicsAnalysis.md` for context on system conflicts.

## Current Session Focus (Updated 2025-06-11)
Completed Tasks 0B.1, 0B.2, 0B.3, 0B.4, 0B.5, and 0B.6 to isolate old system forces, adapt player movement logic, control script execution order, enhance physics mode differentiation, define Hybrid mode behavior, and add detailed logging and debugging tools. Phase 0B is now fully implemented. The next focus will be on testing and refinement.

## Recent Major Fixes

### Critical StartObject Position Fix
**Problem**: Player ball was spawning at incorrect positions in levels despite correct StartObject coordinates in level files.

**Root Cause**: Execution order issue where `Player.Start()` captured the initial position before `Level.Build()` set the StartObject position. When `Player.ResetPosition()` was called (e.g., when hitting dead zones), it reset to the wrong saved position.

**Solution**: Added reflection-based fix in `Level.cs` StartObject processing to update Player's internal saved position fields (`xLastCollectedScoreItemPosition`, `xOrientationAsLastCollectedScoreItem`) after setting StartObject position.

**Impact**: All levels now properly position the player ball at the intended starting location.

# BlockBall Evolution Project Overview

## Project Summary
BlockBall Evolution is a Unity-based game project focused on evolving gameplay mechanics through a physics migration. The primary goal is to transition from a legacy force-based physics system to a hybrid system that supports toggling between Unity's built-in physics, a custom deterministic physics system, and a hybrid mode. This migration is critical for enhancing gameplay predictability and performance.

## Current Focus: Physics Migration Phase 0

### Objective
Phase 0 (comprising Phase 0A and 0B) aims to establish a compatibility layer and implement hybrid physics mode toggling. The goal is to integrate new physics logic without disrupting existing gameplay, ensuring clear behavioral differences between modes, and maintaining rollback capability.

### Phase Breakdown and Progress
- **Phase 0A: Compatibility Layer** (Completed)
  - **Task 0A.1**: Integrate `DeterministicMath` into `PhysicsObjectWrapper.cs`. (Completed, validated with no gameplay disruption.)
  - **Task 0A.2**: Set up `PhysicsSettings` as a `ScriptableObject`. (Completed, asset created in `Assets/Settings/` with default values.)

- **Phase 0B: Hybrid Implementation and Mode Toggling** (In Progress)
  - **Task 0B.1: Isolate Old System Forces in Custom Modes** (Completed)
    - Objective: Prevent old system forces from interfering with new physics modes.
    - Status: Implemented in `PhysicObject.cs` to skip force application when `physicsMode` is `CustomPhysics` or `Hybrid`.
  - **Task 0B.2: Adapt Player Movement Logic for Physics Modes** (Completed)
    - Objective: Ensure player input respects active physics mode.
    - Status: Implemented in `PlayerCameraController.cs` to skip force and torque application in `CustomPhysics` mode.
  - **Task 0B.3: Control Script Execution Order** (Completed)
    - Objective: Prevent update order conflicts between old and new physics logic.
    - Status: Implemented with `ScriptExecutionOrderHelper.cs` in `Assets/Editor` to set execution order: `PhysicObjekt` (-100), `PlayerCameraController` (-50), `PhysicsObjectWrapper` (100).
  - **Task 0B.4: Enhance Physics Mode Differentiation** (Completed)
    - Objective: Make mode differences visually and behaviorally distinct.
    - Status: Implemented in `PhysicsObjectWrapper.cs` with increased gravity multipliers (1.5x for CustomPhysics, 0.7x for Hybrid) and debug visualizations (colored Gizmos: blue for UnityPhysics, green for CustomPhysics, red for Hybrid).
  - **Task 0B.5: Define and Implement Hybrid Mode Behavior** (Completed)
    - Objective: Clarify and balance Hybrid mode between old and new systems.
    - Status: Implemented in `PhysicsObjectWrapper.cs` with refined logic to allow old system input forces from Player script while applying custom gravity with a reduced multiplier (0.7x) for balance.
  - **Task 0B.6: Add Detailed Logging and Debugging** (Completed)
    - Objective: Diagnose physics interference with detailed logs.
    - Status: Implemented comprehensive logging in `PhysicObject.cs`, `PlayerCameraController.cs`, and `PhysicsObjectWrapper.cs` to track Rigidbody state, physics mode, and force/velocity application decisions for debugging.

### Implementation Plan
The physics migration will continue over multiple sessions, focusing on completing Phase 0B tasks. With Task 0B.6 completed, Phase 0B is now fully implemented. The next steps will be to review and test all changes thoroughly to ensure stability and compatibility. Documentation and any additional cleanup or refinement tasks will be addressed in subsequent sessions. Each session will update this overview with progress and blockers.

## Long-Term Goals
- Complete physics migration through subsequent phases, building on Phase 0's foundation.
- Enhance gameplay with deterministic physics for consistency across platforms.
- Optimize performance and maintain backward compatibility for existing players.
