# BlockBall Evolution - Project Overview

## 1. Architecture

### Core Structure
The game follows a component-based architecture with several distinct systems:

#### State Management System
- `ScreenStateManager`: Controls game states (Menu, Game, Loading, Intro)
- `WorldStateManager`: Manages world-related states
- Implemented through a Singleton pattern for global access

#### Level System
- `Level`: Core class that loads, builds and manages level components
- `LevelSet` & `Campain`: Handle collections of levels
- XML-based level definition format stored in `.lvl` files

#### Object Hierarchy
- `BaseObject`: Root class for all interactive objects
- `BallObject`: Base for ball-related objects
- `PhysicObject`: Handles physics interactions
- Key gameplay objects:
  - `Player`: The player-controlled ball
  - `Block`: Building blocks of levels
  - `GravitySwitch`: Changes gravity direction
  - `Goal`: Level completion trigger
  - `ScoreItem`: Collectible diamonds (also function as checkpoints)
  - `KeyItem`: Colored keys to unlock doors
  - `DoorObject`: Gates requiring specific keys
  - `InfoObject`: Displays help messages

#### Camera System
- `PlayerCameraController`: Handles camera movement, rotation, zoom
- Supports full rotation and alignment with gravity direction
- Implements transparency for obstructing objects

#### UI System (in transition)
- Being migrated from legacy PowerUI to Unity's native UI system
- `StandardUIManager`: New UI manager being implemented
- Uses TextMeshPro for text rendering
- `UISetupHelper`: Utility for setting up the new UI components

### Technical Implementation
- Uses Unity's Rigidbody physics for ball movement
- Block-based level design using 8x8x8 "bixels"
- XML serialization for level data
- Object pooling for certain game elements

## 2. Feature Status

| **Level Editor** | ❌ Not Found | Editor functionality not identified in codebase |
| **Campaign Mode** | ⚠️ Partial | Basic structure exists but may need completion |
| **Visual Effects** | ⚠️ Minimal | Limited effects implemented |
| **Sound System** | ❓ Unknown | Sound implementation not identified in examined code |

## 3. Issues and Required Cleanup

### Critical Issues

1. **UI System Migration**
   - PowerUI removal is incomplete
   - New Unity UI/TextMeshPro implementation needs completion
   - Several UI screens need to be created or finalized

2. **Unity 2022.3 Compatibility**
   - While major API incompatibilities have been addressed, some issues may remain
   - MovieTexture-dependent code has been temporarily disabled but needs proper replacement

3. **Code Modernization**
   - Several deprecated Unity patterns and coding practices need updating
   - Method hiding warnings have been addressed but code quality could be improved

### Required Cleanup Tasks (Priority Order)

1. **Complete PowerUI Removal**
   - Follow steps in `PowerUIRemovalSteps.cs` to fully remove PowerUI
   - Finish implementing Unity UI/TextMeshPro replacements for all UI elements
   - Test all UI functionality across different game states

2. **Update Game UI Components**
   - Complete implementation of:
     - Main menu screen
     - Game screen with score, time, and key indicators
     - Loading screen
     - Intro screens

3. **Fix Visual Inconsistencies**
   - Update materials for modern rendering pipeline
   - Replace any deprecated shader code
   - Ensure lighting works correctly with current Unity version

4. **Code Refactoring**
   - Address any remaining compiler warnings
   - Improve code organization and readability
   - Remove commented-out legacy code
   - Add proper documentation

5. **Physics System Bugfix**
   - Blocking issue: The ball sometimes collides with something when it should roll smoothly over blocks
   - Likely due to a bug in the physics system, needs investigation

6. **Testing & Debugging**
   - Test gameplay mechanics thoroughly
   - Verify level loading works correctly
   - Ensure scoring system functions as intended
   - Check performance on target platforms

7. **Asset Optimization**
   - Review and optimize 3D assets
   - Update textures for modern resolution standards
   - Ensure audio is properly implemented with the new Unity Audio system

8. **Feature Completion**
   - Verify or implement the bonus time system
   - Complete any missing gameplay features described in the design doc
   - Add sound effects and music if missing

## 4. Development Roadmap Suggestion

1. **Phase 1: Foundation Repair**
   - Complete UI migration from PowerUI to Unity UI
   - Fix all remaining Unity 2022.3 compatibility issues
   - Basic testing of core gameplay mechanics

2. **Phase 2: Refinement**
   - Improve visuals with modern Unity features
   - Update UI design for better user experience
   - Optimize performance

3. **Phase 3: Feature Completion**
   - Implement any missing features from the original design
   - Add additional polish and feedback elements
   - Create level editor if not present

4. **Phase 4: Release Preparation**
   - Full testing across all gameplay systems
   - Final optimization
   - Platform-specific adaptations if needed
