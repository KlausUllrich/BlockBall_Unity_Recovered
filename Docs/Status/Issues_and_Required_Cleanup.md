# BlockBall Evolution Physics Migration - Issues and Required Cleanup

## Open Issues
- **None at this time**: Documentation for Phases 0 and 1 is complete and tailored for LLM usage.

## Required Cleanup Tasks
- **Old File Archiving or Deletion**: Once the user confirms that the LLM-tailored documentation fully meets requirements and migration progresses, consider archiving or deleting old non-LLM files in `Phase0_Migration_Strategy/` (e.g., `01A_Mission_and_Precision.md` to `01E_Timeline_and_Criteria.md`).
  - **Status**: Awaiting user confirmation. Currently retained as reference.

## Phase 0 Migration Strategy Issues

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. **Airborne Gravity Transitions**: Phase 0 documents do not address gravity switching while the ball is airborne, which is a critical requirement for BlockBall Evolution.
   - **Action Needed**: Add specific tasks or references in Phase 0 to cover this mechanic.
   - **Priority**: High
2. **Instant Gravity Snap on Zone Exit**: The requirement for instant gravity transitions when exiting gravity zones is not mentioned in the migration strategy.
   - **Action Needed**: Include planning for instant snap in Phase 0 or subsequent early phases.
   - **Priority**: High
3. **Slope Rolling Mechanics**: Specific implementation details for ensuring the ball always feels like rolling, especially on slopes, are absent.
   - **Action Needed**: Ensure Phase 0 or later phases address slope rolling explicitly.
   - **Priority**: Medium

### Existing Issues from Previous Phases
- **Phase 3 Overengineering**: As noted in memory, Phase 3 collision system documentation proposes replacing Unity's collision response entirely, conflicting with the 'no overengineering' rule.
  - **Action Needed**: Revise Phase 3 to enhance rather than replace existing systems.
  - **Priority**: High
- **Missing PhysicsSettings Integration**: Phase 3 assumes a centralized `PhysicsSettings` exists, which is not yet implemented in the codebase.
  - **Action Needed**: Ensure `PhysicsSettings` is created in Phase 0A as planned.
  - **Priority**: High

## Resolved Issues
- **IPhysicsObject Wrapper Integration**: Successfully integrated with PlayerSphere on [date]. No observable behavior changes, confirming compatibility with existing Unity physics system. No issues or cleanup required at this stage.

## Risk Mitigation Actions
- **Jump Feel Changes**: Implement extensive playtesting and gradual transition options via `PhysicsMode` to prevent altering player muscle memory.
- **Performance Regression**: Continuous monitoring via `PhysicsProfiler` and automatic fallback if targets are missed.
- **Determinism Issues**: Use fixed-point calculations in `DeterministicMath` and conduct platform testing to avoid variations.

**Directive for LLM**: Log any issues encountered during implementation tasks here with detailed descriptions and actionable resolution steps. Update status to 'Resolved' once fixed. Add cleanup tasks as needed for maintaining project organization.

**Note**: All risks and mitigation actions are logged here for transparency and tracking. Update this document with any new issues or changes in status.
