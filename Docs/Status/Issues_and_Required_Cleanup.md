# BlockBall Physics Migration - Issues and Required Cleanup

## Open Issues
- **None at this time**: Documentation for Phases 0 and 1 is complete and tailored for LLM usage.

## Required Cleanup Tasks
- **Old File Archiving or Deletion**: Once the user confirms that the LLM-tailored documentation fully meets requirements and migration progresses, consider archiving or deleting old non-LLM files in `Phase0_Migration_Strategy/` (e.g., `01A_Mission_and_Precision.md` to `01E_Timeline_and_Criteria.md`).
  - **Status**: Awaiting user confirmation. Currently retained as reference.

## Resolved Issues
- **None recorded yet**: This file will be updated as issues arise and are resolved during implementation.

**Directive for LLM**: Log any issues encountered during implementation tasks here with detailed descriptions and actionable resolution steps. Update status to 'Resolved' once fixed. Add cleanup tasks as needed for maintaining project organization.
