# BlockBall Evolution Physics Migration - Issues and Required Cleanup

## Open Issues
- **None at this time**: Documentation for Phases 0 and 1 is complete and tailored for LLM usage.

## Required Cleanup Tasks
- **Old File Archiving or Deletion**: Once the user confirms that the LLM-tailored documentation fully meets requirements and migration progresses, consider archiving or deleting old non-LLM files in `Phase0_Migration_Strategy/` (e.g., `01A_Mission_and_Precision.md` to `01E_Timeline_and_Criteria.md`).
  - **Status**: Awaiting user confirmation. Currently retained as reference.

## Phase 0 Migration Strategy Issues

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. **Airborne Gravity Transitions**: Phase 0 documents do not address gravity switching while the ball is airborne, which is a critical requirement for BlockBall Evolution.
   - **Action Needed**: Add specific tasks or references in Phase 0 to cover this mechanic.
   - **Priority**: High
2. **Instant Gravity Snap on Zone Exit**: The requirement for instant gravity transitions when exiting gravity zones is not mentioned in the migration strategy.
   - **Action Needed**: Include planning for instant snap in Phase 0 or subsequent early phases.
   - **Priority**: High
3. **Slope Rolling Mechanics**: Specific implementation details for ensuring the ball always feels like rolling, especially on slopes, are absent.
   - **Action Needed**: Ensure Phase 0 or later phases address slope rolling explicitly.
   - **Priority**: Medium

### Existing Issues from Previous Phases
- **Phase 3 Overengineering**: As noted in memory, Phase 3 collision system documentation proposes replacing Unity's collision response entirely, conflicting with the 'no overengineering' rule.
  - **Action Needed**: Revise Phase 3 to enhance rather than replace existing systems.
  - **Priority**: High
- **Missing PhysicsSettings Integration**: Phase 3 assumes a centralized `PhysicsSettings` exists, which is not yet implemented in the codebase.
  - **Action Needed**: Ensure `PhysicsSettings` is created in Phase 0A as planned.
  - **Priority**: High

## Resolved Issues
- **IPhysicsObject Wrapper Integration**: Successfully integrated with PlayerSphere on [date]. No observable behavior changes, confirming compatibility with existing Unity physics system. No issues or cleanup required at this stage.
- **DeterministicMath Implementation**: Implemented on [date] for consistent physics calculations using float32 precision. Integrated into PhysicsObjectWrapper on [date] with RoundVector method added for vector operations; tested and validated on [date] with no observable behavior changes, confirming continued compatibility with existing system.
- **PhysicsProfiler Implementation**: Implemented on [date] to monitor physics performance during migration. Setup script and prefab created for scene integration; instructions provided for manual setup in the main scene via Unity Editor; pending attachment to a GameObject and testing to establish baseline performance metrics.
- **Duplicate PhysicsMode Definition**: Resolved error CS0101 on [date] by removing duplicate PhysicsMode enum from PhysicsSettings.cs, ensuring definition exists only in PhysicsMode.cs.

## Phase 0B: Hybrid Implementation - In Progress
- **PhysicsMode Enum**: Implemented on [date] to define physics system modes (UnityPhysics, CustomPhysics, Hybrid). Added to PhysicsSettings for mode selection; integrated into PhysicsObjectWrapper on [date] for toggling behavior between Unity and custom physics systems, pending testing to validate mode switching.
- **Duplicate Definition Fix**: Resolved error CS0101 on [date] by removing duplicate PhysicsMode enum from PhysicsSettings.cs, ensuring definition exists only in PhysicsMode.cs.
- **Namespace Organization**: Added 'BlockBall.Physics' and 'BlockBall.Settings' namespaces to relevant scripts on [date] for consistent code organization and to prevent future namespace conflicts.
- **PhysicsSettings Asset**: Created PhysicsSettings.asset on [date] in Assets/Settings/ with default parameters and physicsMode set to UnityPhysics for compatibility.
- **PhysicsSettings Path Update**: Updated resource path in PhysicsObjectWrapper.cs on [date] to correctly load PhysicsSettings asset from 'PhysicsSettings' path.
- **Error Handling**: Added try-catch block on [date] for robust loading of PhysicsSettings asset in PhysicsObjectWrapper.cs to handle potential loading errors; updated error message to provide actionable guidance for creating the asset if missing.
- **Type Qualification**: Fully qualified PhysicsSettings type as BlockBall.Settings.PhysicsSettings on [date] in PhysicsObjectWrapper.cs to resolve potential namespace reference issues.

## Risk Mitigation Actions
- **Jump Feel Changes**: Implement extensive playtesting and gradual transition options via `PhysicsMode` to prevent altering player muscle memory.
- **Performance Regression**: Continuous monitoring via `PhysicsProfiler` and automatic fallback if targets are missed.
- **Determinism Issues**: Use fixed-point calculations in `DeterministicMath` and conduct platform testing to avoid variations.

**Directive for LLM**: Log any issues encountered during implementation tasks here with detailed descriptions and actionable resolution steps. Update status to 'Resolved' once fixed. Add cleanup tasks as needed for maintaining project organization.

**Note**: All risks and mitigation actions are logged here for transparency and tracking. Update this document with any new issues or changes in status.
