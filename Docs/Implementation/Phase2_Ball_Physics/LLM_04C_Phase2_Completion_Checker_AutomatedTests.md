# Phase 2: Ball Physics - Completion Checker for Automated Tests

## Objective
Provide a structured framework to aggregate and validate the results of all automated tests from the `LLM_03X` series, ensuring that Phase 2 Ball Physics functionalities meet success criteria with a minimum 90% overall pass rate and 100% for critical areas like jump height and speed limits.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Confirm that automated tests for Phase 2 components (`BallPhysics`, `BallStateMachine`, `GroundDetector`, `BallInputProcessor`) validate the implementation against technical specifications.
- **Scope**: Covers the five automated test suites: Jump Height (`LLM_03A`), State Machine (`LLM_03B`), Ground Detection (`LLM_03C`), Rolling Physics (`LLM_03D`), and Input Processing (`LLM_03E`).
- **Success Criteria**: Overall pass rate of at least 90% across all test cases, with 100% pass rate for critical success criteria (jump height, speed limits, state transitions, etc.).

## Automated Test Results Checklist
Below is a checklist to record the results of each automated test suite. Run each test suite in Unity Test Runner within the Editor, then log the pass/fail status, pass rate, and any deviations or failures for analysis. Each suite corresponds to a specific `LLM_03X` file.

### 1. Jump Height Tests (Ref: LLM_03A_Phase2_Automated_Tests_JumpHeight.md)
- **Critical Area**: Jump height must be exactly 0.75 Unity units (6 Bixels) ± 0.01 unit tolerance.
- [ ] **Test Execution**: Test script `BallJumpHeightTests` run in Unity Test Runner.
- [ ] **Pass Rate**: Record percentage of passing test cases (e.g., 100% if all pass).
- [ ] **Critical Pass**: Confirm 100% pass for jump height precision (0.75 units).
- [ ] **Deviations**: Note any measured jump heights outside tolerance (e.g., 0.76 units).
- [ ] **Log Review**: Check test logs for detailed results (actual height, deviation metrics).

**Notes**: This is a critical success criterion. Any failure here (even one test case) halts Phase 2 completion until resolved.

### 2. State Machine Tests (Ref: LLM_03B_Phase2_Automated_Tests_StateMachine.md)
- **Critical Area**: State transitions must adhere to the validity matrix with no invalid transitions allowed.
- [ ] **Test Execution**: Test script `BallStateMachineTests` run in Unity Test Runner.
- [ ] **Pass Rate**: Record percentage of passing test cases.
- [ ] **Critical Pass**: Confirm 100% pass for valid/invalid transition handling and event firing (`OnStateChanged`).
- [ ] **Deviations**: Note any unexpected state changes or event failures.
- [ ] **Log Review**: Check test logs for details on transition matrix adherence and timer behavior.

**Notes**: State transition accuracy is critical for gameplay logic. Failures in matrix adherence are high-priority issues.

### 3. Ground Detection Tests (Ref: LLM_03C_Phase2_Automated_Tests_GroundDetection.md)
- **Critical Area**: Ground contact detection within 0.55-0.6 units (hysteresis) and slope detection (>45° for Sliding).
- [ ] **Test Execution**: Test script `GroundDetectorTests` run in Unity Test Runner.
- [ ] **Pass Rate**: Record percentage of passing test cases.
- [ ] **Critical Pass**: Confirm 100% pass for detection thresholds (0.55/0.6 units) and slope angle triggering Sliding state.
- [ ] **Deviations**: Note any incorrect ground detection or state flickering issues.
- [ ] **Log Review**: Check test logs for detected distances, slope angles, and stability results.

**Notes**: Hysteresis is critical to prevent state flickering. Any failure in thresholds or slope detection requires immediate attention.

### 4. Rolling Physics Tests (Ref: LLM_03D_Phase2_Automated_Tests_RollingPhysics.md)
- **Critical Area**: Three-tier speed limits (6, 6.5, 7 u/s) and angular velocity matching linear velocity (radius 0.5 units).
- [ ] **Test Execution**: Test script `BallRollingPhysicsTests` run in Unity Test Runner.
- [ ] **Pass Rate**: Record percentage of passing test cases.
- [ ] **Critical Pass**: Confirm 100% pass for speed limit enforcement (Input 6 u/s, Physics 6.5 u/s, Total 7 u/s) and rolling realism.
- [ ] **Deviations**: Note any speed limit breaches or mismatches in angular/linear velocity.
- [ ] **Log Review**: Check test logs for measured speeds, velocity correlations, and friction/drag effects.

**Notes**: Speed limits are a critical success criterion. Even minor deviations (outside ±0.05 u/s tolerance) are unacceptable.

### 5. Input Processing Tests (Ref: LLM_03E_Phase2_Automated_Tests_InputProcessing.md)
- **Critical Area**: Camera-relative input, diagonal normalization, jump buffering (0.1s), and coyote time (0.15s).
- [ ] **Test Execution**: Test script `BallInputProcessorTests` run in Unity Test Runner.
- [ ] **Pass Rate**: Record percentage of passing test cases.
- [ ] **Critical Pass**: Confirm 100% pass for jump buffering (0.1s), coyote time (0.15s), and diagonal input normalization.
- [ ] **Deviations**: Note any incorrect input direction, magnitude exploits, or timing failures.
- [ ] **Log Review**: Check test logs for input directions, magnitudes, and timing accuracies.

**Notes**: Timing mechanics for jumps and input normalization are critical for gameplay feel. Failures here are high priority.

### 6. Gravity Zone System Tests (Ref: LLM_03F_Phase2_Automated_Tests_GravityZoneSystem.md)
- **Critical Area**: Gravity zone detection, airborne gravity transition, instant gravity transition, cardinal axis snapping, and multi-zone handling.
- [ ] **Test Execution**: Test script `GravityZoneSystemTests` run in Unity Test Runner.
- [ ] **Pass Rate**: Record percentage of passing test cases.
- [ ] **Critical Pass**: Confirm 100% pass for gravity zone detection, airborne gravity transition, instant gravity transition, cardinal axis snapping, and multi-zone handling.
- [ ] **Deviations**: Note any incorrect gravity zone detection, airborne gravity transition, instant gravity transition, cardinal axis snapping, or multi-zone handling issues.
- [ ] **Log Review**: Check test logs for detailed results (actual vs. expected values).

**VALIDATION PRIORITY**: HIGHEST - These tests validate the core missing functionality that broke airborne gravity transitions.

**CRITICAL VALIDATION CRITERIA:**
- **Airborne Transition**: Ball must enter Transitioning state when entering gravity zone while airborne
- **Instant Gravity Changes**: Gravity direction must change INSTANTLY based on ball position within zone (no smooth transitions)
- **Position-Based Calculation**: Gravity direction = normalized vector from zone pivot to ball position
- **Cardinal Snapping**: Gravity must snap to nearest cardinal axis when exiting all zones
- **Multi-Zone Priority**: Closest pivot point must determine active zone in overlapping zones

### 7. Single Source of Truth Compliance Tests (Ref: LLM_03G_Phase2_Automated_Tests_SingleSourceOfTruth.md)
- **Critical Area**: No hardcoded physics constants, physics settings integration, and parameter consistency.
- [ ] **Test Execution**: Test script `SingleSourceOfTruthTests` run in Unity Test Runner.
- [ ] **Pass Rate**: Record percentage of passing test cases.
- [ ] **Critical Pass**: Confirm 100% pass for no hardcoded physics constants, physics settings integration, and parameter consistency.
- [ ] **Deviations**: Note any hardcoded physics constants, physics settings integration issues, or parameter consistency problems.
- [ ] **Log Review**: Check test logs for detailed results (actual vs. expected values).

**Notes**: Single source of truth compliance is critical for maintainability and scalability. Any failure in this area requires immediate attention.

## Validation Instructions
1. **Run Tests**: Execute all automated test suites in Unity Test Runner (accessible via Window > General > Test Runner in Unity Editor). Ensure tests are run in Edit Mode for consistency.
2. **Record Results**: For each suite, note the pass rate (e.g., 8/10 tests passed = 80%) and check if critical areas achieve 100% pass. Use the Test Runner’s output or exported results.
3. **Critical Criteria Check**: Verify that critical success criteria (jump height, speed limits, state transitions, timing mechanics, gravity zone system, and single source of truth compliance) have no failing test cases. Any failure in these areas halts Phase 2 completion.
4. **Analyze Failures**: For any failing test, review the detailed log (actual vs. expected values) to identify the root cause. Document issues in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.
5. **Aggregate Scoring**: Calculate the overall pass rate as (Total Passing Tests / Total Tests) * 100%. This must be ≥90%. Critical areas must be 100%.

## Scoring
- **Total Test Cases**: Sum of all test cases across the seven suites (count individual test methods in each script, e.g., 7 suites * ~5 tests each = ~35 total).
- **Overall Pass Rate**: (Number of Passed Tests / Total Test Cases) * 100%. Must be ≥90%.
- **Critical Pass Rate**: For critical areas (identified in each suite), pass rate must be 100%. These include jump height, speed limits, state transitions, timing mechanics, gravity zone system, and single source of truth compliance.
- **Weighting**: If overall pass rate is below 90% but critical areas are 100%, note this as a partial pass requiring review. If any critical area fails, this section fails regardless of overall rate.
