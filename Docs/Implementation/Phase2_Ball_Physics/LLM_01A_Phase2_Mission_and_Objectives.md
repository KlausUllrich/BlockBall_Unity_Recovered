# Phase 2: Ball Physics - Mission and Objectives

## Mission Statement
Implement comprehensive ball physics including rolling mechanics, jumping, state management, and camera-relative input processing. This phase builds upon Phase 1's foundation to create the complete ball control system critical for BlockBall Evolution gameplay.

## Phase Objectives
1. **Ball State Machine**: Implement grounded, airborne, sliding, and transitioning states to manage ball behavior dynamically.
2. **Rolling Physics**: Achieve realistic ball rolling with friction and angular velocity constraints for natural movement.
3. **Jump Mechanics**: Ensure precise 6-Bixel (0.75 Unity unit) jumps with buffering for responsive control.
4. **Input Processing**: Enable camera-relative movement with diagonal normalization for intuitive player input.
5. **Speed Control**: Enforce a three-tier speed limiting system to balance gameplay and physics realism.

## Context & Dependencies
**Requires Phase 1 Completion**: This phase depends on the core architecture established in Phase 1:
- `BlockBallPhysicsManager` for object registration and management.
- `IPhysicsObject` interface for standardized physics integration.
- `VelocityVerletIntegrator` for accurate physics calculations.
- Performance profiling and debugging systems for optimization.

## Next Steps
After understanding the mission and objectives, proceed to `LLM_01B_Phase2_Technical_Specifications.md` for detailed technical parameters and requirements.
