# Phase 2: Ball Physics - Completion Checker for Performance Profiling

## Objective
Provide a comprehensive framework to profile and validate the performance of Phase 2 Ball Physics components after integration with Phase 1 systems, ensuring adherence to strict performance targets (<2ms physics frame, 0KB allocation) and identifying any bottlenecks for optimization before Phase 2 completion.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Ensure that Phase 2 components (`BallPhysics`, `BallStateMachine`, `BallInputProcessor`, `BallController`, `GroundDetector`) maintain high performance when integrated with Phase 1 architecture (`BlockBallPhysicsManager`, `VelocityVerletIntegrator`, `PhysicsProfiler`) in realistic gameplay scenarios.
- **Scope**: Covers profiling of physics update times, memory allocations, frame rate impact, and identification of optimization opportunities using Unity Profiler and custom `PhysicsProfiler` tools.
- **Success Criteria**: Physics updates must average <2ms per frame, allocations must be 0KB per second during steady state, and overall frame rate impact must be minimal (maintain 60+ FPS in test scenes). Pass rate of 100% for critical performance metrics.

## Performance Profiling Checklist
Below is a detailed checklist for profiling Phase 2 components. Use Unity Profiler, `PhysicsProfiler` (from Phase 1), and custom debug logs in test scenes that simulate typical and stress-test gameplay conditions. Record Pass/Fail for each metric and note any deviations or bottlenecks.

### 1. Physics Update Time Profiling
These tests measure the time taken for physics updates, critical to maintaining game responsiveness.
- [ ] **Single Ball Update Time**: Profile a scene with one ball (all Phase 2 components active). Confirm `BallPhysics.PhysicsUpdate()` takes <2ms per frame on average via `PhysicsProfiler`.
  - **Expectation**: Average update time <2ms over 100 frames.
  - **Notes**: Record average and peak times (e.g., 1.5ms avg, 2.2ms peak).
- [ ] **Stress Test Update Time**: Profile a scene with multiple physics objects (e.g., 5-10 balls or other `IPhysicsObject` instances). Confirm total physics update time remains <2ms per frame.
  - **Expectation**: Total physics time (all objects) <2ms average.
  - **Notes**: Note if scaling causes spikes (e.g., 3ms with 10 objects).
- [ ] **State Transition Impact**: Force frequent state changes (e.g., Grounded to Airborne via jumps every second). Confirm no significant time spikes during transitions.
  - **Expectation**: Update time remains <2ms during state changes.
  - **Notes**: Note any spikes (e.g., 2.5ms during jump).

### 2. Memory Allocation Profiling
These tests ensure zero-allocation goals are met to prevent garbage collection pauses.
- [ ] **Steady State Allocation**: Run a scene with continuous ball movement for 1 minute. Confirm 0KB allocation per second after initial load via Unity Profiler or `PhysicsProfiler`.
  - **Expectation**: No allocations (0KB/s) during steady movement.
  - **Notes**: Record any allocations (e.g., 0.5KB on state change).
- [ ] **Event-Based Allocation**: Trigger events like state transitions, jumps, and input changes. Confirm no allocations occur during these events.
  - **Expectation**: 0KB allocation on jumps, state changes, etc.
  - **Notes**: Note specific events causing allocations.
- [ ] **Long-Term Allocation**: Run a scene for 5+ minutes with varied gameplay (movement, jumps, slopes). Confirm no cumulative allocations over time.
  - **Expectation**: Total allocation remains 0KB after initial load.
  - **Notes**: Note if allocations creep up (e.g., 1KB after 3 minutes).

### 3. Frame Rate and System Impact
These tests evaluate broader performance impact on the game loop and rendering.
- [ ] **Frame Rate in Simple Scene**: Run a minimal scene (one ball, basic terrain). Confirm frame rate remains 60+ FPS (or matches baseline without physics) via Unity Profiler or in-game FPS counter.
  - **Expectation**: FPS ≥60 or within 5% of baseline.
  - **Notes**: Record FPS (e.g., 58 FPS vs 62 baseline).
- [ ] **Frame Rate in Complex Scene**: Run a complex scene (multiple objects, effects, full level). Confirm frame rate impact from physics is minimal.
  - **Expectation**: Physics contributes <5% to frame time (e.g., <0.8ms in 16.67ms frame).
  - **Notes**: Note FPS drop attributable to physics.
- [ ] **No Main Thread Blocking**: Confirm physics updates (fixed 50Hz timestep) do not block main thread or cause stutters in rendering.
  - **Expectation**: No visible stutters, main thread frame time unaffected by physics spikes.
  - **Notes**: Note any visible hitching or delays.

### 4. Bottleneck Identification and Optimization Opportunities
These tests analyze specific components or scenarios for optimization potential, even if within targets.
- [ ] **Component Breakdown**: Use Unity Profiler to break down update time by component (`BallPhysics`, `GroundDetector`, etc.). Identify if any single component dominates time.
  - **Expectation**: No single component exceeds 50% of physics budget (e.g., <1ms of 2ms).
  - **Notes**: Record breakdown (e.g., `GroundDetector` 0.8ms, 40%).
- [ ] **Ground Detection Cost**: Profile raycast/sphere cast operations in `GroundDetector`. Confirm minimal impact even with complex terrain.
  - **Expectation**: Raycasts contribute <0.5ms per frame.
  - **Notes**: Note if complex geometry spikes cost (e.g., 0.7ms).
- [ ] **Optimization Notes**: Document any areas for potential optimization, even if passing (e.g., reduce raycast frequency, cache calculations).
  - **Expectation**: Identify at least 1-2 optimization ideas if any metric is near threshold (e.g., 1.8ms update).
  - **Notes**: List specific suggestions or “None needed” if optimal.

## Validation Instructions
1. **Setup Test Scenes**: Create two scenes in Unity Editor:
   - **Simple Scene**: One ball with Phase 2 components, minimal terrain, no extra effects.
   - **Complex Scene**: Full level with multiple physics objects, visual effects, and typical gameplay elements.
2. **Profile with Tools**: Use Unity Profiler (Window > Analysis > Profiler) and `PhysicsProfiler` (Phase 1) to collect data on update times, allocations, and FPS. Enable deep profiling if needed for detailed breakdowns.
3. **Run Test Scenarios**: Execute each checklist item under controlled conditions (e.g., continuous movement, frequent jumps). Record data over multiple frames (e.g., average over 100 frames) for accuracy.
4. **Record Results**: Mark Pass/Fail based on expectations. Log detailed metrics (e.g., “1.7ms avg update time”) and any deviations or bottlenecks in notes.
5. **Document Issues**: For failing metrics or near-threshold results, log issues in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md` with profiling data and scene conditions.
6. **Scoring**: Calculate pass rate as (Passed Items / Total Items) * 100%. Critical metrics (update time, allocations) must pass 100%.

## Scoring
- **Total Checklist Items**: 12 (as listed above).
- **Overall Pass Rate**: (Number of Passed Items / Total Items) * 100%. Must be ≥90%.
- **Critical Pass Rate**: Critical metrics (single ball update time <2ms, 0KB allocation) must achieve 100% pass. Any critical failure halts Phase 2 completion.
- **Optimization Weighting**: Even if passing, near-threshold results (e.g., 1.9ms update) should be noted for future optimization and may lower effective score if multiple are near limits.

## Next Steps
After completing performance profiling and ensuring metrics meet targets, compile all completion checker results (from `LLM_04A` to `LLM_04F`) into a final Phase 2 completion report in `/Status/Project_Overview.md`. Log any performance issues or optimization needs in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`. If all sections pass, Phase 2 is ready for final validation and sign-off. If not, address critical failures before proceeding.
