# Phase 2: Ball Physics - Deliverables and Success Criteria

## Phase 2 Deliverables

### Core Components
1. **BallPhysics.cs**: Main ball physics component implementing `IPhysicsObject` for physics calculations.
2. **BallStateMachine.cs**: State management system handling Grounded, Airborne, Sliding, and Transitioning states.
3. **BallInputProcessor.cs**: Camera-relative input handling for intuitive player control.
4. **BallController.cs**: High-level ball control coordination, integrating input and physics.
5. **GroundDetector.cs**: Ground contact detection system for determining ball state based on surface interaction.

### Integration Points
- **PhysicObject.cs**: Will be refactored to use new `BallPhysics` for consistent physics application.
- **Player.cs**: Integration with new ball control system for player interaction.
- **Camera System**: Must work with new input processing for camera-relative movement.
- **Block Collision**: Ground detection compatibility with level geometry for accurate state transitions.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Ball rolls smoothly without jitter or unexpected jumping.
- [ ] Jump height exactly 0.75 units (6 Bixels) consistently across different scenarios.
- [ ] Input feels responsive and correctly camera-relative for intuitive control.
- [ ] State transitions are smooth and predictable between all defined states.
- [ ] All speed limits (input 6 u/s, physics 7 u/s, total 8 u/s) enforced correctly.
- [ ] Ground detection works accurately on slopes up to 45Â° for state determination.
- [ ] Performance remains <2ms with ball physics active to maintain game fluidity.

## Context & Dependencies
**Requires Phase 1 Completion**: This phase depends on the core architecture established in Phase 1:
- `BlockBallPhysicsManager` for object registration and management.
- `IPhysicsObject` interface for standardized physics integration.

## Validation Instructions
1. **Deliverables Check**: Ensure each core component (`BallPhysics`, `BallStateMachine`, etc.) is clearly defined with its role and integration points understood.
2. **Criteria Alignment**: Confirm that success criteria align with gameplay goals (smooth rolling, precise jumps) and performance targets (<2ms).
3. **Integration Mapping**: Validate that integration points with existing systems (`PhysicObject`, `Player`, etc.) are accounted for in planning.

## Next Steps
After understanding the deliverables and success criteria, proceed to `LLM_01D_Phase2_Risks_and_Challenges.md` for details on potential risks and mitigation strategies for Phase 2.
