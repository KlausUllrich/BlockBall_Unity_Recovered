# Phase 2: Ball Physics - Completion Checker for Component Implementation

## Objective
Provide a detailed checklist to confirm that all Phase 2 Ball Physics components (`BallPhysics`, `BallStateMachine`, `BallInputProcessor`, `BallController`, `GroundDetector`) are fully implemented as per the specifications in the `LLM_02X` task files and are operational within the Unity project.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Ensure each component meets the functional requirements outlined in its respective task file, forming the foundation for Phase 2 completion validation.
- **Scope**: Covers the five core components of Phase 2, checking for presence, key features, and basic functionality in the Unity environment.
- **Success Criteria**: All checklist items for each component must be marked as complete (Pass) with no critical omissions.

## Component Implementation Checklist
Below is a detailed checklist for each component. Verify each item in the Unity Editor or through code inspection. Record Pass/Fail for each item and note any issues for resolution.

### 1. BallStateMachine (Ref: LLM_02A_BallStateMachine_Task.md)
- [ ] **Class Existence**: `BallStateMachine.cs` exists in the project under the `BlockBall.Physics` namespace.
- [ ] **State Definitions**: Defines four states: `Grounded`, `Airborne`, `Sliding`, `Transitioning` as an enum `BallState`.
- [ ] **Transition Matrix**: Implements a transition validity matrix allowing specific transitions (e.g., Grounded to Airborne, not Airborne to Sliding).
- [ ] **State Tracking**: Tracks `CurrentState`, `PreviousState`, and `StateTimer` for duration in current state.
- [ ] **Transition Method**: `TryTransitionTo()` method checks matrix validity and logs reason for failed transitions.
- [ ] **Event System**: `OnStateChanged` event fires on successful transitions with previous and current state parameters.
- [ ] **Update Method**: `Update()` increments `StateTimer` per frame.
- [ ] **Debug Logging**: Logs state changes and failed transition attempts for debugging.

**Notes**: Ensure the transition matrix matches the exact specifications from `LLM_02A`. Any deviation is a critical failure.

### 2. BallPhysics (Ref: LLM_02B_BallPhysics_Component_Task.md)
- [ ] **Class Existence**: `BallPhysics.cs` exists in the project under the `BlockBall.Physics` namespace.
- [ ] **IPhysicsObject Interface**: Implements `IPhysicsObject` for integration with Phase 1 `BlockBallPhysicsManager`.
- [ ] **Physics Update**: `PhysicsUpdate()` applies Velocity Verlet integration for position and velocity updates.
- [ ] **Speed Limiting**: Enforces three-tier speed limits (Input 6 u/s, Physics 6.5 u/s, Total 7 u/s) with exponential decay above 6.65 u/s.
- [ ] **Jump Mechanics**: Implements fixed jump height of 0.75 units (6 Bixels) via `RequestJump()`.
- [ ] **Rolling Mechanics**: Calculates angular velocity based on linear velocity (radius 0.5 units) for realistic rolling.
- [ ] **Friction and Drag**: Applies friction (Grounded) and drag (Airborne) per `PhysicsSettings` coefficients.
- [ ] **State Integration**: References `BallStateMachine` to adjust physics behavior based on state.
- [ ] **Profiling**: Uses `PhysicsProfiler` to track update times and allocations.

**Notes**: Speed limits and jump height are critical success criteria. Deviations here require immediate correction.

### 3. BallInputProcessor (Ref: LLM_02C_BallInputProcessor_Task.md)
- [ ] **Class Existence**: `BallInputProcessor.cs` exists in the project under the `BlockBall.Physics` namespace.
- [ ] **Camera-Relative Input**: Processes input relative to camera orientation using forward and right vectors.
- [ ] **Diagonal Normalization**: Normalizes diagonal input (e.g., forward+right) to prevent speed exploits (magnitude ≤ 1.0).
- [ ] **Jump Buffering**: Implements 0.1s buffer to queue jump input before grounding.
- [ ] **Coyote Time**: Allows jump within 0.15s after leaving ground for forgiving control.
- [ ] **Input to Physics**: Translates processed input to velocity commands for `BallPhysics`.
- [ ] **State Awareness**: Adjusts input processing based on `BallStateMachine` state (e.g., disable input during Transitioning).
- [ ] **Debug Tools**: Provides debug logs for input values and timing mechanics.

**Notes**: Timing values (0.1s buffer, 0.15s coyote) are critical for gameplay feel. Validate precision in implementation.

### 4. BallController (Ref: LLM_02D_BallController_Task.md)
- [ ] **Class Existence**: `BallController.cs` exists in the project under the `BlockBall.Physics` namespace.
- [ ] **Component Coordination**: References `BallPhysics`, `BallInputProcessor`, and `BallStateMachine` for coordinated control.
- [ ] **Input Control**: Enables/disables input processing based on high-level game conditions (e.g., player inactive).
- [ ] **Behavior Logic**: Defines rules for ball behavior (e.g., when to apply physics effects).
- [ ] **State Feedback**: Reacts to state changes via `OnStateChanged` to trigger gameplay events (e.g., sound effects).
- [ ] **Player Integration**: Connects to existing `Player.cs` for alignment with broader player systems.
- [ ] **Debug Tools**: Includes debug visualization or logging for control flow.

**Notes**: Ensure integration with existing `Player.cs` does not introduce conflicts or break existing functionality.

### 5. GroundDetector (Ref: LLM_02E_GroundDetector_Task.md)
- [ ] **Class Existence**: `GroundDetector.cs` exists in the project under the `BlockBall.Physics` namespace.
- [ ] **Ground Detection**: Uses raycasts or sphere casts to detect ground within 0.55 units (enter Grounded).
- [ ] **Hysteresis Logic**: Applies different threshold (0.6 units) for leaving Grounded state to prevent flickering.
- [ ] **Slope Detection**: Calculates slope angle from surface normal, triggering Sliding state above 45°.
- [ ] **State Recommendation**: Recommends state transitions to `BallStateMachine` based on detection (Grounded, Sliding, Airborne).
- [ ] **Collision Support**: Optionally uses `OnCollisionStay`/`Exit` for additional contact data.
- [ ] **Debug Visualization**: Draws debug rays (e.g., green for grounded, red for airborne) in Unity Editor.

**Notes**: Hysteresis and slope thresholds are critical to prevent state flickering and ensure correct Sliding behavior.

## Validation Instructions
1. **Code Inspection**: Open each component’s script in the Unity project or IDE to confirm the presence of required methods, variables, and logic as per `LLM_02X` files.
2. **Component Presence**: In Unity Editor, attach each component to a test GameObject (e.g., ball prefab) and confirm it appears in the Inspector.
3. **Basic Functionality**: For each component, perform a basic runtime test in a simple scene to ensure no immediate errors (e.g., null references) occur on start or update.
4. **Checklist Completion**: Mark each checklist item as Pass/Fail. All items must pass for this section to be considered complete. Critical items (speed limits, jump height, etc.) cannot fail.
5. **Issue Logging**: For any failing items, log detailed issues in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md` with steps to reproduce and expected behavior.

## Scoring
- **Total Items**: Count of all checklist items (currently 38 across 5 components).
- **Pass Rate**: (Number of Passed Items / Total Items) * 100%. Must be 100% for this section, as these are foundational implementations.
- **Critical Failures**: Any failure in items related to critical success criteria (e.g., jump height, speed limits) halts Phase 2 completion until resolved.

## Next Steps
After completing this component implementation checklist, proceed to `LLM_04C_Phase2_Completion_Checker_AutomatedTests.md` to validate automated test results. Log progress in `/Status/Project_Overview.md` and any issues in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.
