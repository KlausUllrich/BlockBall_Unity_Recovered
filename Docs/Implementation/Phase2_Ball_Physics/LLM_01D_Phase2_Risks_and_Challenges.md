# Phase 2: Ball Physics - Risks and Challenges

## Risk Mitigation
- **Gradual Integration**: Implement alongside the existing system using feature flags to toggle between old and new physics for testing.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Develop unit tests for each component to catch issues early in development.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use continuous profiling during development to ensure performance targets (<2ms) are met.
- **Rollback Capability**: Maintain the ability to revert to Phase 1 physics implementation if critical issues arise during Phase 2 deployment.

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Precise Jump Height
- **Issue**: Achieving exactly 6 Bixels (0.75 Unity units) jump height consistently across varying conditions.
- **Solution**: Calculate exact initial velocity based on gravity and target height using the formula `v = sqrt(2 * g * h)` where `h = 0.75` units.
- **Validation**: Test jump height under different scenarios (flat ground, slopes) to ensure consistency.

### Challenge 2: Rolling Constraint
- **Issue**: Ball must roll realistically without sliding unnaturally on surfaces.
- **Solution**: Implement angular velocity constraint with `Ï‰ = v / r` to match rotation to linear velocity.
- **Validation**: Visually confirm wheel rotation matches movement speed; test on various surface types.

### Challenge 3: State Transitions
- **Issue**: Ensuring smooth transitions between grounded, airborne, sliding, and transitioning states.
- **Solution**: Introduce hysteresis in ground detection and gradual friction changes to prevent abrupt state shifts.
- **Implementation**: Use different thresholds for entering and leaving states to avoid flickering.
- **Validation**: Test state transitions under rapid condition changes (e.g., quick ground-to-air shifts).

### Challenge 4: Camera-Relative Input
- **Issue**: Movement direction must account for camera orientation and gravity direction for intuitive control.
- **Solution**: Project camera vectors onto a gravity-perpendicular plane to calculate movement direction.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios where the camera is parallel to the gravity direction to avoid input errors.
- **Validation**: Test input responsiveness with various camera angles and gravity orientations.

## Context & Dependencies
**Requires Phase 1 Completion**: This phase depends on the core architecture established in Phase 1:
- `BlockBallPhysicsManager` for object registration and management.
- `IPhysicsObject` interface for standardized physics integration.

## Validation Instructions
1. **Risk Assessment**: Ensure each risk (integration, performance) has a clear mitigation strategy (feature flags, profiling) that can be practically applied.
2. **Challenge Solutions**: Confirm that solutions to challenges (jump height formula, rolling constraint) are mathematically sound and testable.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Validate that edge cases, especially for camera-relative input, are identified and addressed in the implementation plan.

## Next Steps
After understanding the risks and challenges, proceed to `LLM_01E_Phase2_Integration_Strategy.md` for details on integration with Phase 1 systems and existing codebase.
