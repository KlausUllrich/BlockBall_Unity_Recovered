# Phase 2: Ball Physics - Integration Strategy

## Phase 1 Dependencies
- **IPhysicsObject Interface**: Used by `BallPhysics.cs` to ensure standardized physics integration.
- **BlockBallPhysicsManager**: Registers and manages ball physics objects for centralized control.
- **VelocityVerletIntegrator**: Leveraged for accurate physics calculations in ball movement and jumping.
- **Performance Profiling System**: Utilized to monitor and optimize ball physics performance (<2ms target).

## Existing System Integration
- **PhysicObject.cs**: Gradually replace with `BallPhysics.cs` to transition to the new physics system while maintaining compatibility.
- **Player.cs**: Adapt input handling to integrate with the new `BallInputProcessor.cs` and `BallController.cs` for seamless player control.
- **Camera System**: Ensure proper integration with `BallInputProcessor.cs` for camera-relative movement input.
- **Level System**: Maintain compatibility with existing level loading and block collision for accurate ground detection via `GroundDetector.cs`.

## Integration Steps
1. **Setup Phase 1 Components**: Ensure `BlockBallPhysicsManager` and `VelocityVerletIntegrator` are operational as the foundation for Phase 2 components.
2. **Parallel Implementation**: Develop Phase 2 components (`BallPhysics.cs`, `BallStateMachine.cs`, etc.) alongside existing systems using feature flags to toggle between old and new implementations.
3. **Component Linking**: Connect `BallPhysics.cs` to `IPhysicsObject` and register with `BlockBallPhysicsManager` for physics updates.
4. **Input Integration**: Wire `BallInputProcessor.cs` to the camera system and `Player.cs` for camera-relative input handling.
5. **Collision Compatibility**: Configure `GroundDetector.cs` to work with existing level geometry for state detection.
6. **Testing and Iteration**: Use performance profiling to monitor impact and iterate on integration to meet performance targets.
7. **Gradual Rollout**: Slowly phase out `PhysicObject.cs` as `BallPhysics.cs` proves stable in testing environments.

## Documentation Requirements
- **Complete API Documentation**: Add XML comments for all public members of Phase 2 components.
- **Usage Examples**: Provide examples of how to configure and use each component (`BallPhysics`, `BallStateMachine`, etc.).
- **Integration Guide**: Detail step-by-step integration with existing systems (`Player.cs`, camera, level system).
- **Performance Notes**: Document memory usage and optimization tips for maintaining <2ms performance.
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: List common integration issues (e.g., state transition glitches) and their solutions.

## Context & Dependencies
**Requires Phase 1 Completion**: This phase builds directly on the architecture established in Phase 1 for physics management and integration standards.

## Validation Instructions
1. **Dependency Check**: Confirm that all Phase 1 components (`IPhysicsObject`, `BlockBallPhysicsManager`) are in place and understood for integration.
2. **Integration Mapping**: Ensure each integration point (`PhysicObject.cs` to `BallPhysics.cs`) has a clear transition plan.
3. **Documentation Plan**: Validate that documentation requirements cover API usage, integration steps, and troubleshooting for LLM clarity.

## Next Steps for Phase 3 Prerequisites
Phase 3 (Collision System) will require:
- Stable ball physics implementation with `BallPhysics.cs`.
- Reliable ground detection system via `GroundDetector.cs`.
- Consistent state management through `BallStateMachine.cs`.
- Performance within targets (<2ms for ball physics).
- Complete integration with existing `Player.cs` component.

## Next Steps in Documentation
After understanding the integration strategy, proceed to `LLM_02A_BallStateMachine_Task.md` to begin the implementation tasks for Phase 2 components.
