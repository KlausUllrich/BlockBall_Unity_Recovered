# BlockBall Physics Migration Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for migrating BlockBall Evolution from Unity physics to a custom deterministic physics system. The documentation is split into phases, with each phase having LLM-tailored files optimized for automated processing with modular structure, explicit instructions, validation steps, and machine-readable metadata.

## Documentation by Phase
- **Phase 0: Foundation and Compatibility Layer** - Located in `Phase0_Migration_Strategy/` folder
  - Overview files: `LLM_01A` to `LLM_01E` (mission, phases, parameters, rollback, timeline)
  - Implementation tasks: `LLM_02A` to `LLM_02E` (settings, interface, math, profiler, checklist)
  - See `Phase0_Migration_Strategy/README.md` for detailed file list and directives.

- **Phase 1: Hybrid Implementation** - Located in `Phase1_Migration_Strategy/` folder
  - Overview: `LLM_03A_Phase1_Overview.md`
  - Implementation tasks: `LLM_03B_Phase1_Tasks.md` (hybrid system, testing)
  - See `Phase1_Migration_Strategy/README.md` for detailed file list and directives.

## Directive for LLM
Start with Phase 0 documentation in `Phase0_Migration_Strategy/LLM_01A_Mission_and_Precision.md` and follow the sequence. Ensure prerequisites are met before proceeding to subsequent phases. Log progress in `/Status/Project_Overview.md` and issues in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.
