## Modular Structure of Phase 3 Collision System Documentation

This documentation is split into smaller, focused files to ensure each is under 200 lines for optimal LLM processing. Below is the categorized list of documents for Phase 3:

### Core Overview and Objectives
- **01_Overview.md**: High-level mission, objectives, and workflow (this document)
- **02_Implementation_Tasks_Summary.md**: Summary and index of modular implementation tasks

### Implementation Tasks (Modular)
- **Task_3.1_ContactPoint.md**: Data structure for collision contact information
- **Task_3.2_MaterialProperties.md**: Essential material properties for collision response
- **Task_3.3_CollisionResponse.md**: Deterministic collision response algorithms

### Test Cases and Validation
- **03_Test_Cases.md**: Automated and manual test scenarios for collision system validation
- **04_Completion_Checker.md**: Checklist and automated validation script for Phase 3 completion

## Workflow for LLM Implementation

**New Workflow**: When implementing modular components:
1. **Start with Overview Documents**: Begin with `01_Overview.md` for mission and context.
2. **Follow Implementation Tasks**: Proceed to `02_Implementation_Tasks_Summary.md` for an index of tasks, then address each modular task file (`Task_3.1_ContactPoint.md`, `Task_3.2_MaterialProperties.md`, `Task_3.3_CollisionResponse.md`) in sequence.
3. **Validate with Test Cases**: Use `03_Test_Cases.md` to implement and run test suites after completing tasks.
4. **Check Completion**: Refer to `04_Completion_Checker.md` to ensure all criteria are met before moving to Phase 4.
5. **Cross-Reference Between Files**: Use 'Related Documents' sections in each file to maintain context and continuity.

**Purpose of Modular Structure**: Documents are split to maintain under 200 lines each while preserving all content, ensuring optimal LLM processing with complete context and zero information loss.

**Implementation Priority**:
1. ContactPoint Data Structure (`Task_3.1_ContactPoint.md`)
2. MaterialProperties System (`Task_3.2_MaterialProperties.md`)
3. CollisionResponse Algorithms (`Task_3.3_CollisionResponse.md`)
4. Run test suites to validate implementation (`03_Test_Cases.md`)

## Directive for LLM
Start with `01_Overview.md` for a high-level understanding and follow the workflow sequence for implementation. Use YAML headers or structured sections for context, dependencies, and validation steps in each document. Log progress in `/Docs/Status/Project_Overview.md` and issues in `/Docs/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.

**Purpose of Tailoring**: These documents are optimized for LLM usage with a modular structure, explicit instructions, error handling, and clear metadata to ensure complete understanding and zero-error execution.

## Key Technical Specifications

### Collision Detection Strategy
- **Primary Method**: Unity's collision detection (reliable, optimized)
- **Response Method**: Custom deterministic algorithms (predictable, controllable)

### Material System
- **Metal Blocks**: High restitution (0.6), low friction (0.2)
- **Wood Blocks**: Medium restitution (0.4), medium friction (0.5)
- **Stone Blocks**: Low restitution (0.2), high friction (0.8)
- **Ice Blocks**: Medium restitution (0.3), very low friction (0.1)
- **Bouncy Blocks**: High restitution (0.7), low friction (0.3)

### Contact Resolution
