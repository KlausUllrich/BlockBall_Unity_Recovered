# Phase 3: Collision System Overview

## Mission Statement
Implement a comprehensive collision detection and response system that provides deterministic, smooth collisions while maintaining the hybrid approach of Unity detection with custom response algorithms. This phase creates the foundation for all ball-environment interactions.

## Phase Objectives
1. **Collision Detection**: Hybrid system using Unity's collision detection with custom response
2. **Contact Resolution**: Deterministic collision response with proper bounce mechanics
3. **Ground Contact**: Reliable ground detection and constraint resolution
4. **Surface Materials**: Different material properties affecting bounce and friction
5. **Edge Case Handling**: Robust handling of corner cases, penetration recovery, and stuck ball scenarios

## Context & Dependencies
**Requires Phase 1**: Core physics architecture and Velocity Verlet integration
**Requires Phase 2**: Ball physics component, state machine, and ground detection foundation

## Key Technical Specifications

### Collision Detection Strategy
- **Primary Method**: Unity's collision detection (reliable, optimized)
- **Response Method**: Custom deterministic algorithms (predictable, controllable)
- **Detection Layers**: Environment (blocks), Walls, Ground, Hazards
- **Contact Generation**: Multiple contact points per collision
- **Penetration Recovery**: Automatic correction for deep penetrations

### Bounce Mechanics
- **Restitution Range**: 0.1 (soft) to 0.7 (bouncy) based on contact angle
- **Formula**: `restitution = baseRestitution * (1 - contactAngle/90°)`
- **Energy Conservation**: Velocity magnitude reduced by (1 - restitution)
- **Direction Calculation**: Perfect reflection with surface normal
- **Minimum Bounce**: Prevent infinite micro-bounces below threshold

### Material System
- **Metal Blocks**: High restitution (0.6), low friction (0.2)
- **Wood Blocks**: Medium restitution (0.4), medium friction (0.5)
- **Stone Blocks**: Low restitution (0.2), high friction (0.8)
- **Ice Blocks**: Medium restitution (0.3), very low friction (0.1)
- **Bouncy Blocks**: High restitution (0.7), low friction (0.3)

### Contact Resolution
- **Contact Points**: Up to 4 points per collision
- **Resolution Order**: Penetration correction, then velocity response
- **Iterator Limit**: Maximum 3 resolution iterations per contact
- **Stability Threshold**: Minimum relative velocity for response (0.01 u/s)

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Deterministic Response
**Issue**: Unity's collision detection can be non-deterministic
**Solution**: Cache collision data and process with custom algorithms
**Implementation**: Store contact points, normals, and material data

### Challenge 2: Penetration Recovery
**Issue**: Deep penetrations can cause unstable behavior
**Solution**: Multi-step penetration correction with safety limits
**Validation**: Ball never penetrates more than 10% of radius

### Challenge 3: Corner Collisions
**Issue**: Ball hitting block corners can produce unpredictable results
**Solution**: Special case detection for edge/corner contacts
**Implementation**: Contact point analysis and averaged normal calculation

### Challenge 4: Multiple Simultaneous Collisions
**Issue**: Ball contacting multiple surfaces simultaneously
**Solution**: Priority system and iterative contact resolution
**Order**: Ground contacts first, then walls, then ceiling

## Risk Mitigation
