# Phase 3: Collision System Implementation Tasks Summary

**IMPORTANT:** Phase 3 integrates with Phase 1's centralized `PhysicsSettings` - all collision material properties come from this single source of truth!

## Overview
This document serves as a summary and index for the modularized implementation tasks of the Phase 3 Collision System. Due to the original document size exceeding the recommended 200-line limit for optimal LLM processing, the content has been split into smaller, focused files.

## Modular Task Documents
1. **[Task 3.1: Create ContactPoint Data Structure](Task_3.1_ContactPoint.md)**
   - Defines the data structure for collision contact information.

2. **[Task 3.2: Create MaterialProperties ScriptableObject](Task_3.2_MaterialProperties.md)**
   - Details the material properties system for collision responses.

3. **[Task 3.3: Create CollisionResponse System](Task_3.3_CollisionResponse.md)**
   - Describes the deterministic collision response algorithms.

## Documentation Requirements for Each Task
- **XML Documentation**: Document all public classes, methods, and fields
- **Usage Examples**: Provide practical examples for each component
- **Performance Notes**: Highlight optimization strategies and considerations

## Related Documents
- See overview in `01_Overview.md` for high-level context
- Review test cases in `03_Test_Cases.md` for validation scenarios
- Check completion criteria in `04_Completion_Checker.md` for project readiness

## Next Steps
Continue reviewing and updating each modular task document to ensure alignment with the physics specifications and requirements matrix. Log progress and issues in `/Docs/Status/Project_Overview.md` and `/Docs/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.
