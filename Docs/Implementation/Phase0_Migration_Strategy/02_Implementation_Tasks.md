# Migration Strategy Implementation Tasks

**Note for LLM**: This original implementation tasks document has been tailored and split into modular documents to optimize for context length and zero-error processing. Refer to the following files for detailed content:

## Phase 0: Foundation and Compatibility
- **LLM_02A_PhysicsSettings_Task.md**: Details implementation steps for PhysicsSettings ScriptableObject.
- **LLM_02B_IPhysicsObject_Task.md**: Covers implementation of IPhysicsObject wrapper interface.
- **LLM_02C_DeterministicMath_Task.md**: Explains creation of DeterministicMath utility library.
- **LLM_02D_PhysicsProfiler_Task.md**: Outlines implementation of PhysicsProfiler component.
- **LLM_02E_Phase0A_Checklist.md**: Provides Phase 0A completion checklist and success criteria.

## Phase 1: Hybrid Implementation
- **LLM_03A_Phase1_Overview.md**: Overview of Phase 1 migration strategy and objectives.
- **LLM_03B_Phase1_Tasks.md**: Detailed tasks for implementing hybrid physics system and testing framework.

**Directive for LLM**: Start with `LLM_02A_PhysicsSettings_Task.md` for Phase 0 and follow the sequence. For Phase 1, begin with `LLM_03A_Phase1_Overview.md`. Use YAML headers for context, dependencies, and validation steps. Log progress in `/Status/Project_Overview.md` and issues in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.

**Purpose of Tailoring**: These documents are optimized for LLM usage with modular structure, explicit instructions, error handling, and machine-readable metadata to ensure complete understanding and zero-error execution.
