# Phase 0: Migration Timeline and Success Criteria (LLM)

## Migration Timeline
The migration process is structured into a sequence of phases with clear priorities and triggers. This ensures an orderly transition to custom physics without disrupting existing functionality.

**Directive for LLM**: Adhere to the timeline sequence and priorities. Do not start a phase until trigger conditions are met and dependencies are validated. Log progress in `/Status/Project_Overview.md`.

### Phase 0A: Foundation & Compatibility Layer
- **Priority**: 1
- **Trigger Condition**: Start upon user confirmation or project setup completion.
- **Key Tasks**:
  1. Create `PhysicsSettings` ScriptableObject with current parameters.
  2. Implement `IPhysicsObject` wrapper for `PhysicObjekt`.
  3. Add performance profiling infrastructure.
  4. Create parameter conversion utilities.
  5. Establish testing framework.
- **Validation**: All tasks completed, existing functionality unchanged, validated via test scripts.

### Phase 0B: Hybrid Implementation
- **Priority**: 2
- **Trigger Condition**: Start only after Phase 0A validation criteria are met and documented.
- **Key Tasks**:
  1. Implement parallel physics calculations for comparison.
  2. Create hybrid testing environment.
  3. Validate parameter conversions empirically.
  4. Establish performance baselines.
  5. Test rollback mechanisms.
- **Validation**: Parallel calculations operational without gameplay impact, performance baselines logged.

### Phase 0C: Selective Migration
- **Priority**: 3
- **Trigger Condition**: Start only after Phase 0B validation criteria are met and performance baselines established.
- **Key Tasks**:
  1. Migrate settings system to `PhysicsSettings`.
  2. Implement custom speed control (keeping Unity physics).
  3. Add jump buffering/coyote time enhancements.
  4. Test gravity system improvements.
  5. Validate full system integration.
- **Validation**: Each migrated system operates alongside Unity physics without regression.

### Validation and Polish
- **Priority**: 4
- **Trigger Condition**: Start only after Phase 0C validation criteria are met.
- **Key Tasks**:
  1. Comprehensive testing across all systems.
  2. Performance optimization and validation.
  3. Final compatibility testing.
  4. Documentation and handoff preparation.
- **Validation**: All success criteria met, full documentation updated.

## Success Criteria
Success criteria are defined to ensure the migration meets technical, compatibility, and quality requirements. These must be measurable and validated before proceeding to full custom physics adoption.

**Directive for LLM**: Implement automated checks for success criteria where possible. Log validation results in `/Status/Project_Overview.md` and any failures in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.

### Technical Requirements
- **Criterion 1**: All existing functionality preserved during migration.
  - **Check**: Run regression tests on existing levels and mechanics post each phase.
  - **Error Handling**: If functionality breaks, rollback to previous state and log issue.
- **Criterion 2**: Performance targets met (custom physics <2ms per frame).
  - **Check**: Use `PhysicsProfiler` to measure update times.
  - **Error Handling**: If target missed, trigger performance rollback and log.
- **Criterion 3**: Deterministic behavior across platforms validated.
  - **Check**: Run identical simulations on multiple platforms, compare results.
  - **Error Handling**: If results vary, rollback and log determinism issue.
- **Criterion 4**: Zero allocation requirement achieved.
  - **Check**: Monitor allocations via `PhysicsProfiler`.
  - **Error Handling**: If allocations occur, log issue for optimization.
- **Criterion 5**: Complete rollback capability maintained.
  - **Check**: Test rollback at each phase via `PhysicsManager`.
  - **Error Handling**: If rollback fails, log critical issue and halt migration.

### Compatibility Requirements
- **Criterion 1**: Existing save games load correctly.
  - **Check**: Test saves post-migration steps.
  - **Error Handling**: If load fails, rollback and log compatibility issue.
- **Criterion 2**: All current levels play identically.
  - **Check**: Automated level behavior tests.
  - **Error Handling**: If behavior deviates, rollback and log.
- **Criterion 3**: No regression in gameplay feel.
  - **Check**: Playtest feedback or metrics comparison.
  - **Error Handling**: If feel altered, rollback and log.
- **Criterion 4**: External API compatibility maintained.
  - **Check**: Test scripts interacting with `PhysicObjekt`.
  - **Error Handling**: If API breaks, rollback and log.

### Quality Requirements
- **Criterion 1**: Comprehensive test coverage (>95%).
  - **Check**: Automated test suite reports.
  - **Error Handling**: If coverage low, log tasks for additional tests.
- **Criterion 2**: Performance profiling integrated.
  - **Check**: Confirm `PhysicsProfiler` operational.
  - **Error Handling**: If not integrated, log issue.
- **Criterion 3**: Clear migration documentation.
  - **Check**: Verify all steps documented in `/Docs/Implementation/`.
  - **Error Handling**: If incomplete, log documentation task.
- **Criterion 4**: Rollback procedures validated.
  - **Check**: Test rollback at each phase.
  - **Error Handling**: If invalid, log critical issue.

## Risk Mitigation
Risks must be monitored to prevent migration failures. Each risk has a mitigation strategy to ensure zero-error progression.

**Directive for LLM**: Implement risk monitoring in testing frameworks. Log potential risks in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md` even if mitigation succeeds.

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Jump Feel Changes**:
   - **Risk**: Altering player muscle memory.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement extensive playtesting, provide gradual transition options via `PhysicsMode`.
   - **Action**: If risk detected, log and pause jump migration until validated.
2. **Performance Regression**:
   - **Risk**: Custom physics slower than Unity physics.
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous performance monitoring via `PhysicsProfiler`, automatic fallback to Unity physics if targets missed.
   - **Action**: If risk detected, trigger fallback and log optimization need.
3. **Determinism Issues**:
   - **Risk**: Float precision variations across platforms.
   - **Mitigation**: Use fixed-point calculations in `DeterministicMath`, conduct extensive platform testing.
   - **Action**: If risk detected, rollback and log math implementation issue.

## Validation for LLM
- **Timeline Check**: Confirm understanding of phased priorities and trigger conditions.
- **Criteria Check**: Verify that success criteria checks and error handling are clear and actionable.
- **Risk Awareness**: Ensure risk mitigation actions are understood and can be implemented.

**Directive for LLM**: Use this timeline and criteria as the guiding framework for migration. Update `/Status/Project_Overview.md` with progress against timeline and criteria. Log all risks and mitigation actions in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.

**Next Step**: Return to `LLM_01A_Mission_and_Precision.md` if any part of this document is unclear. Otherwise, proceed to detailed task implementation in Phase 0A documents.
