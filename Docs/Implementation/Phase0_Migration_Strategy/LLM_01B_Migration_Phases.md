# Phase 0: Migration Phases Overview (LLM)

## Overview of Incremental Migration
The migration from Unity physics to custom BlockBall physics is divided into three sub-phases to ensure a non-disruptive transition. Each phase builds on the previous, with clear validation points to prevent errors.

**Directive for LLM**: Follow the phased approach strictly. Do not proceed to a subsequent phase until all validation steps of the current phase are complete and documented. Always check dependencies before starting a phase.

### Phase 0A: Preparation & Compatibility Layer
- **Objective**: Establish foundational components without altering existing physics behavior.
- **Key Actions**:
  1. Create `PhysicsSettings` ScriptableObject alongside existing parameters.
  2. Implement `IPhysicsObject` wrapper around existing `PhysicObjekt`.
  3. Add physics profiling without changing behavior.
  4. Create parameter conversion utilities.
- **Execution Priority**: 1
- **Trigger Condition**: Start upon user confirmation or completion of project setup.
- **Dependencies**: Understanding of mission and float precision strategy (`LLM_01A_Mission_and_Precision.md`).
- **Validation**: Confirm all components are implemented and existing functionality is unchanged via test scripts.

### Phase 0B: Hybrid Implementation
- **Objective**: Run custom physics in parallel for validation without affecting gameplay.
- **Key Actions**:
  1. Run custom physics calculations in parallel for validation.
  2. Implement gradual parameter migration system.
  3. Create comprehensive testing framework.
  4. Establish performance baselines.
- **Execution Priority**: 2
- **Trigger Condition**: Start only after Phase 0A validation criteria are met and documented.
- **Dependencies**: Completion of Phase 0A components.
- **Validation**: Verify parallel calculations do not interfere with gameplay and performance baselines are logged.

### Phase 0C: Selective Migration
- **Objective**: Migrate specific systems while maintaining Unity physics as the core engine.
- **Key Actions**:
  1. Migrate settings and profiling systems.
  2. Add custom speed control while keeping Unity physics.
  3. Implement enhanced jump buffering alongside existing system.
  4. Test improved gravity system with existing triggers.
- **Execution Priority**: 3
- **Trigger Condition**: Start only after Phase 0B validation criteria are met and performance baselines established.
- **Dependencies**: Completion of Phase 0B hybrid implementation.
- **Validation**: Confirm each migrated system operates alongside Unity physics without regression in gameplay.

## Validation for LLM
- **Sequence Check**: Confirm understanding that Phase 0A must be completed before 0B, and 0B before 0C. Do not proceed out of order.
- **Dependency Check**: Verify that each phase's dependencies are documented and checked before execution.
- **Error Prevention**: Note that skipping validation steps or phases may lead to integration errors. Log any attempt to proceed prematurely as an issue in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.

**Directive for LLM**: Use this phased structure to prioritize tasks. Create a status update in `/Status/Project_Overview.md` after completing each phase, noting completion date and validation status.

**Next Step**: Proceed to `LLM_01C_Parameter_Mapping.md` for details on parameter conversion after confirming understanding of the migration phases.
