# Phase 0: Rollback Strategy (LLM)

## Overview of Rollback Mechanisms
A robust rollback strategy is critical to ensure that migration to custom physics can be reversed at any stage without loss of functionality. This document outlines mechanisms for switching between physics systems and preserving compatibility.

**Directive for LLM**: Implement rollback mechanisms as a priority in all migration phases. Ensure that every change can be undone, and log rollback readiness in status updates.

## Runtime Physics Toggle
- **Purpose**: Allow switching between Unity physics and custom physics at runtime to facilitate testing and rollback.
- **Implementation**:
  ```csharp
  // File: Assets/Scripts/Physics/PhysicsManager.cs
  // Purpose: Manage physics system mode and enable runtime switching
  public enum PhysicsMode
  {
      UnityPhysics,    // Fallback to original system
      HybridPhysics,   // Partial custom implementation
      CustomPhysics    // Full custom system
  }

  public class PhysicsManager : MonoBehaviour
  {
      public PhysicsMode currentMode = PhysicsMode.UnityPhysics;
      
      public void SwitchPhysicsMode(PhysicsMode mode)
      {
          // Safe runtime switching between physics systems
          // Preserve current state (position, velocity) during transition
          currentMode = mode;
          ApplyPhysicsMode();
      }
      
      private void ApplyPhysicsMode()
      {
          // Logic to enable/disable custom physics components
          // Ensure no state loss during switch
          // TODO: Implement component toggling based on mode
      }
  }
  ```
- **Validation Steps**:
  1. Create `PhysicsManager.cs` at the specified path.
  2. Attach `PhysicsManager` component to a persistent GameObject in the scene (e.g., GameManager).
  3. Test mode switching in a sandbox scene to ensure no state loss (position, velocity preserved).
  4. If state loss or errors occur during switch, log issue in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md` with error details.
- **Error Handling**: If mode switching fails or causes crashes, default to `UnityPhysics` mode and log error: "Physics mode switch failed. Reverted to UnityPhysics. Check PhysicsManager implementation."

## Compatibility Preservation
- **Existing Save Games**:
  - **Requirement**: Must continue to work throughout migration.
  - **Action**: Ensure custom physics components do not alter serialized data formats used in saves.
  - **Validation**: Test loading existing saves after each migration step. If save fails to load, log issue: "Save game compatibility broken at [Phase/Step]. Revert changes to serialization."
- **Level Compatibility**:
  - **Requirement**: All existing levels must function identically.
  - **Action**: Maintain legacy physics behavior as default until full migration is validated.
  - **Validation**: Run automated level tests post-migration steps. If level behavior deviates, log issue: "Level compatibility issue at [Phase/Step]. Check physics interactions."
- **Component Interface**:
  - **Requirement**: `PhysicObjekt` behavior unchanged externally.
  - **Action**: Use wrappers (`IPhysicsObject`) to ensure external API compatibility.
  - **Validation**: Test existing scripts interacting with `PhysicObjekt`. If API breaks, log issue: "API compatibility broken for PhysicObjekt at [Phase/Step]. Adjust wrapper."
- **Performance Guarantee**:
  - **Requirement**: Auto-fallback if performance targets not met.
  - **Action**: Implement performance checks in `PhysicsProfiler` to trigger fallback to `UnityPhysics` if thresholds exceeded.
  - **Validation**: Simulate high load and confirm fallback triggers. If fallback fails, log issue: "Performance fallback failed. Check PhysicsProfiler thresholds."

## Rollback Triggers
The following conditions must trigger an automatic rollback to Unity physics:
1. **Performance Targets Not Met**: If physics update exceeds target (e.g., >2ms per frame) after optimization attempts.
   - **Action**: Switch to `UnityPhysics` mode and log: "Performance target missed. Rolled back to UnityPhysics. Optimization needed."
2. **Gameplay Feel Altered**: If playtesting indicates significant deviation in control or mechanics.
   - **Action**: Revert to previous mode and log: "Gameplay feel regression detected. Rolled back to previous mode. Review changes."
3. **Save Game Compatibility Issues**: If saves fail to load or behave inconsistently.
   - **Action**: Revert and log: "Save compatibility issue. Rolled back. Check serialization impact."
4. **Determinism Failures**: If physics behavior varies across platforms.
   - **Action**: Revert and log: "Determinism failure across platforms. Rolled back. Review DeterministicMath."
5. **Negative Feedback**: If user or stakeholder feedback indicates issues.
   - **Action**: Pause migration, revert if requested, and log: "Negative feedback received. Migration paused/rolled back as per request."

**Directive for LLM**: Monitor for rollback triggers during all phases. Implement automated checks where possible (e.g., performance via `PhysicsProfiler`). Log all rollback events or potential triggers in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.

## Validation for LLM
- **Rollback Mechanism Check**: Confirm understanding of `PhysicsManager` and mode switching implementation.
- **Trigger Awareness**: Verify ability to detect rollback triggers and act (revert and log).
- **Compatibility Focus**: Ensure preservation actions for saves, levels, and APIs are clear and prioritized.

**Directive for LLM**: Update `/Status/Project_Overview.md` with rollback strategy implementation status. Ensure rollback mechanisms are tested in each phase before proceeding with migration steps.

**Next Step**: Proceed to `LLM_01E_Timeline_and_Criteria.md` for details on migration timeline and success criteria after confirming understanding of rollback strategy.
