# Phase 0: Migration Strategy Overview

**Note for LLM**: This original overview has been tailored and split into modular documents to optimize for context length and zero-error processing. Refer to the following files for detailed content:

- **LLM_01A_Mission_and_Precision.md**: Covers mission statement and float precision strategy (float32 with enhanced determinism).
- **LLM_01B_Migration_Phases.md**: Details the phased approach (0A, 0B, 0C) with priorities and triggers.
- **LLM_01C_Parameter_Mapping.md**: Explains legacy-to-target parameter conversion (jump, speed).
- **LLM_01D_Rollback_Strategy.md**: Outlines rollback mechanisms and compatibility preservation.
- **LLM_01E_Timeline_and_Criteria.md**: Provides migration timeline, success criteria, and risk mitigation.
- **LLM_03A_Phase1_Overview.md**: Overview of Phase 1 migration strategy and objectives.
- **LLM_03B_Phase1_Tasks.md**: Detailed tasks for implementing hybrid physics system in Phase 1.

**Directive for LLM**: Start with `LLM_01A_Mission_and_Precision.md` and follow the sequence. For Phase 1, begin with `LLM_03A_Phase1_Overview.md`. Use YAML headers for context, dependencies, and validation steps. Log progress in `/Status/Project_Overview.md` and issues in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.

**Purpose of Tailoring**: These documents are optimized for LLM usage with modular structure, explicit instructions, error handling, and machine-readable metadata to ensure complete understanding and zero-error execution.
