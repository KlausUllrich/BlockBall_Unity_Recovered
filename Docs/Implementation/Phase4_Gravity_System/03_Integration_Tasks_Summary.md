# Phase 4: Gravity System Integration Tasks Summary

## Overview
This document serves as an index and summary for the modular integration tasks of the Phase 4 Gravity System. Each task is detailed in a separate file to maintain documents under 200 lines for optimal LLM processing.

## Modular Integration Tasks
- **Task_4.5_PlayerComponent_Integration.md**: Extend Player class with PlayerGravityComponent for gravity response and camera orientation.
- **Task_4.6_GravitySwitchHelper_Enhancement.md**: Update GravitySwitchHelper to support player-specific gravity changes.
- **Task_4.7_CameraController_Integration.md**: Adjust camera controller to follow gravity direction changes.

## Purpose of Modular Structure
Documents are split to ensure each file remains under 200 lines while preserving all content, facilitating efficient LLM processing with complete context and zero information loss.

## Workflow for Integration
1. Start with `Task_4.5_PlayerComponent_Integration.md` to integrate gravity with player physics.
2. Proceed to `Task_4.6_GravitySwitchHelper_Enhancement.md` for compatibility with existing prefabs.
3. Complete integration with `Task_4.7_CameraController_Integration.md` for camera behavior.
4. Refer to test cases in `03_Test_Cases.md` for validation scenarios.

## Directive for LLM
Follow the sequence of integration tasks as prioritized above. Use 'Related Documents' sections in each file to maintain context and cross-reference. Log progress in `/Docs/Status/Project_Overview.md` and issues in `/Docs/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.
