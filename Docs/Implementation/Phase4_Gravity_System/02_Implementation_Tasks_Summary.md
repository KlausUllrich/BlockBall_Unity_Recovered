# Phase 4: Gravity System Implementation Tasks Summary

## Overview
This document serves as an index and summary for the modular implementation tasks of the Phase 4 Gravity System. Each task is detailed in a separate file to maintain documents under 200 lines for optimal LLM processing.

## Modular Implementation Tasks
- **Task_4.1_PlayerGravityManager.md**: Core player-specific gravity management system that handles instant transitions inside trigger zones and snapping to cardinal directions on exit.
- **Task_4.2_PlayerGravityTrigger.md**: Trigger component for gravity zones, detecting player entry/exit and providing target gravity direction.
- **Task_4.3_GravityDirectionUtility.md**: Utility for calculating nearest cardinal direction for gravity snapping.
- **Task_4.4_PhysicsSettings.md**: Single source of truth for physics configuration, including gravity settings.

## Purpose of Modular Structure
Documents are split to ensure each file remains under 200 lines while preserving all content, facilitating efficient LLM processing with complete context and zero information loss.

## Workflow for Implementation
1. Start with `Task_4.1_PlayerGravityManager.md` for the core gravity management system.
2. Proceed to `Task_4.2_PlayerGravityTrigger.md` for trigger zone detection logic.
3. Implement utility and configuration with `Task_4.3_GravityDirectionUtility.md` and `Task_4.4_PhysicsSettings.md`.
4. Refer to integration tasks in `03_Integration_Tasks.md` for connecting with player and camera systems.

## Directive for LLM
Follow the sequence of tasks as prioritized above. Use 'Related Documents' sections in each file to maintain context and cross-reference. Log progress in `/Docs/Status/Project_Overview.md` and issues in `/Docs/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.
