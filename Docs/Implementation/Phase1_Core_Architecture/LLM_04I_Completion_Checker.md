# Completion Checker for Phase 1 Core Architecture

## Objective
Ensure all components, deliverables, and test cases for Phase 1 of the BlockBall Evolution physics migration are fully implemented, tested, and documented, meeting all success criteria before proceeding to Phase 2.

## Background
Phase 1 focuses on establishing the core architecture for a custom Velocity Verlet-based physics system running at 50Hz. Completion requires all components to be implemented, validated through tests, and documented for future phases.

## Checklist for Phase 1 Completion

### 1. Deliverables Validation
- [ ] **PhysicsSettings ScriptableObject**: Implemented with configurable timestep (0.02s for 50Hz), substep limits (max 8), and conversion utilities. Validate by checking if settings can be adjusted in Unity Editor and accessed programmatically.
- [ ] **BlockBallPhysicsManager Singleton**: Implemented as the central manager for physics updates, object registration, and profiler integration. Confirm it correctly updates physics at fixed timestep.
- [ ] **IPhysicsObject Interface**: Defined with methods for position, velocity, acceleration, and mass. Verify all physics objects implement this interface.
- [ ] **VelocityVerletIntegrator**: Implemented with Velocity Verlet algorithm, handling substeps and ensuring energy conservation (±0.1%). Validate with a simple falling ball test.
- [ ] **PhysicsProfiler**: Implemented to monitor frame times, substeps, and allocations. Confirm it logs warnings for frame times > 0.02s and errors for any allocations.

### 2. Integration Points
- [ ] **Physics Update Loop**: Confirm `BlockBallPhysicsManager` drives updates independent of Unity's frame rate using accumulator pattern.
- [ ] **Object Registration**: Verify physics objects can be dynamically registered/unregistered with the manager during runtime.
- [ ] **Profiler Feedback**: Ensure `PhysicsProfiler` data is accessible and logged regularly for performance monitoring.

### 3. Test Case Results
- [ ] **Fixed Timestep Validation**: Test passed with physics updates consistently at 0.02s intervals across varying frame rates (30fps, 60fps, 120fps).
- [ ] **Energy Conservation**: Test passed with energy drift below ±0.1% over 10 seconds (500 steps) for a falling ball.
- [ ] **Performance Stress Test**: Test passed with 50 objects, maintaining physics frame times under 0.02s and zero allocations in hot path over 1000 frames.

### 4. Documentation
- [ ] **All LLM-Tailored Files**: Confirm all Phase 1 documentation files (Overview, Deliverables, Task, Code, Test Cases) are created with YAML metadata, explicit instructions, and validation steps.
- [ ] **Status Updates**: Ensure `/Status/Project_Overview.md` reflects Phase 1 completion under Physics Migration section.
- [ ] **Issue Tracking**: Verify `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md` lists any remaining issues or blockers from Phase 1 testing.

## Validation Steps for LLM
1. Review each deliverable against its task and code documentation to confirm implementation matches specifications.
2. Check test case logs to ensure all success criteria are met with no failures.
3. Verify integration points by running a full test scene with multiple physics objects, confirming update loop, registration, and profiler functionality.
4. Scan documentation for completeness; each component must have Task and Code files with `validation_status` updated to "Validated" if complete.
5. Update project status files with Phase 1 results, flagging any unresolved issues for cleanup.

## Error Handling Instructions for LLM
- If any deliverable is incomplete, reference its Task file (e.g., `LLM_04C_PhysicsSettings_Task.md`) and complete missing steps before re-checking.
- If test cases fail, log detailed failure data and revisit the corresponding component's implementation task for root cause analysis.
- Do not mark Phase 1 as complete if any test fails or deliverables are missing; document issues in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.
- If documentation is incomplete, create missing files or update existing ones with required metadata and instructions.

## Assumptions
- All Phase 1 components are implemented in Unity 2022.3 with C# scripts.
- Test scenes are available or can be created to validate deliverables and test cases.
- Status files (`/Status/`) are accessible for updates post-validation.

## Next Steps After Completion
- Mark Phase 1 as complete in `/Status/Project_Overview.md` and note any minor cleanup items in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.
- Prepare for Phase 2 by reviewing integration with player controls and camera systems.
- If validation fails, prioritize fixing test failures and incomplete deliverables before proceeding.
