# Phase 1: Deliverables and Success Criteria

## Phase 1 Deliverables
1. **BlockBallPhysicsManager**: Central physics coordinator.
2. **IPhysicsObject Interface**: Standardized physics object contract.
3. **VelocityVerletIntegrator**: Core integration algorithm.
4. **PhysicsProfiler**: Performance monitoring system.
5. **ObjectPoolManager**: Memory management for physics calculations.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Physics runs at exactly 50Hz regardless of framerate.
- [ ] Energy conservation within 1% over 10-second test.
- [ ] Frame time consistently <2ms.
- [ ] Zero memory allocation during physics updates.
- [ ] Smooth ball movement without jitter.

## Integration Points
- **Current PhysicObject.cs**: Will be refactored to implement IPhysicsObject.
- **Player.cs**: Ball control logic will integrate with new physics system.
- **Camera System**: Must sync with fixed timestep physics.
- **Debug System**: Enhanced physics debugging capabilities.
