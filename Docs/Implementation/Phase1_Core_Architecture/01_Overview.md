# Phase 1: Core Architecture Overview

## Mission Statement
Establish the foundational custom physics architecture for BlockBall Resurrection, replacing Unity's default physics with a Velocity Verlet-based system that runs at fixed 50Hz timestep.

## Phase Objectives
1. **Replace Unity Physics**: Completely disable Unity's physics system for the ball
2. **Implement Velocity Verlet**: Superior energy conservation for smooth gameplay
3. **Fixed Timestep**: Deterministic 50Hz physics independent of framerate
4. **Performance Foundation**: <2ms physics frame time with zero allocations

## Context & Background
- **Current Problem**: Ball "jumps" between blocks due to Unity physics inconsistencies
- **Root Cause**: Unity's physics solver conflicts with custom gravity implementation
- **Solution**: Custom physics with Velocity Verlet integration for predictable behavior

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Integration Method**: Velocity Verlet (±0.1% energy conservation vs Semi-Implicit Euler ±2-5%)
- **Timestep**: Fixed 50Hz (0.02s) with accumulator pattern for stability
- **Substeps**: Up to 8 substeps for collision-heavy scenarios
- **Memory**: Object pooling for zero allocation in physics hot path

## Phase 1 Deliverables
1. **BlockBallPhysicsManager**: Central physics coordinator
2. **IPhysicsObject Interface**: Standardized physics object contract
3. **VelocityVerletIntegrator**: Core integration algorithm
4. **PhysicsProfiler**: Performance monitoring system
5. **ObjectPoolManager**: Memory management for physics calculations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Physics runs at exactly 50Hz regardless of framerate
- [ ] Energy conservation within 1% over 10-second test
- [ ] Frame time consistently <2ms
- [ ] Zero memory allocation during physics updates
- [ ] Smooth ball movement without jitter

## Integration Points
- **Current PhysicObject.cs**: Will be refactored to implement IPhysicsObject
- **Player.cs**: Ball control logic will integrate with new physics system
- **Camera System**: Must sync with fixed timestep physics
- **Debug System**: Enhanced physics debugging capabilities

## Risk Mitigation
- **Rollback Plan**: Feature flag to switch between old/new physics
- **Performance Monitor**: Real-time physics timing display
- **Test Framework**: Automated physics behavior validation
- **Documentation**: Complete code documentation for future maintenance

## Next Phase Dependencies
Phase 2+ depend on this foundation being rock-solid. Any instability here will cascade through all subsequent phases.
