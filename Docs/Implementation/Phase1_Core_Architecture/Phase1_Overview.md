# Phase 1: Core Architecture Overview & Task Manual

**Note for LLM and Users**: This overview serves as both a high-level summary of Phase 1 Core Architecture for BlockBall Evolution physics migration and a manual on how to approach the tasks and documents. The original content has been tailored and split into modular documents to optimize for context length and zero-error processing. Refer to the files listed below for detailed content.

## Manual: How to Approach Phase 1 Tasks

### Step 1: Understand the Big Picture
- Start by reviewing **LLM_04A_Phase1_Overview.md** to grasp the mission of replacing Unity's default physics with a custom Velocity Verlet-based system at 50Hz, key objectives, and technical decisions like energy conservation (±0.1%) and fixed timestep.
- Check **LLM_04B_Phase1_Deliverables.md** to understand what success looks like, including specific components and integration points.

### Step 2: Tackle Implementation Tasks Sequentially
- **Begin with PhysicsSettings (LLM_04C_*)**: Implement the configuration foundation first, as all other components depend on it. Follow the task file for step-by-step instructions and refer to the code file for complete examples.
- **Move to BlockBallPhysicsManager (LLM_04D_*)**: Set up the central update loop next, ensuring it handles the fixed timestep correctly.
- **Define IPhysicsObject (LLM_04E_*)**: Implement the interface for physics objects to interact with the system.
- **Implement VelocityVerletIntegrator (LLM_04F_*)**: Focus on the core integration logic for energy conservation, using substeps as needed.
- **Add PhysicsProfiler (LLM_04G_*)**: Finally, integrate performance monitoring to ensure the system meets timing (<0.02s) and allocation (zero in hot path) targets.
- For each component, read the **Task** file first for instructions, then consult the **Code** file for implementation details if needed.

### Step 3: Validate with Test Cases
- After implementing components, execute the tests outlined in **LLM_04H_Test_Cases.md**. These cover timestep consistency, energy conservation, and performance under load.
- Log test results meticulously, noting any deviations from success criteria (e.g., energy drift > ±0.1%).

### Step 4: Confirm Completion
- Use **LLM_04I_Completion_Checker.md** to verify every deliverable, integration point, and test case is complete. Do not proceed to Phase 2 until all checklist items are marked as done.
- Update status files: Add progress to `/Status/Project_Overview.md` under Physics Migration, and note any issues in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`.

### Tips for Efficiency
- **Modular Focus**: Each document is self-contained with YAML metadata, explicit instructions, and validation steps. Focus on one at a time to avoid context overload.
- **Error Handling**: If a step fails (e.g., test case or implementation), refer to the error handling sections in each file for root cause analysis before proceeding.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisites are met before starting a task (e.g., `PhysicsSettings` before `BlockBallPhysicsManager`).

## Directive for LLM
Start with `LLM_04A_Phase1_Overview.md` for a high-level understanding, then follow the sequence outlined in this manual for implementation. Use YAML headers in each file for context, dependencies, and validation steps. Log progress in `/Status/Project_Overview.md` and issues in `/Status/Issues_and_Required_Cleanup.md`. Adhere to a zero-error policy by following explicit instructions and validation checks.

**Purpose of Tailoring**: These documents are optimized for LLM usage with a modular structure, explicit instructions, error handling, and machine-readable metadata to ensure complete understanding and zero-error execution. For human users, this manual provides a clear roadmap to navigate the documentation and tasks efficiently.
